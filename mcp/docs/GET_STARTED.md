## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Single Package Security Check
```
You: "Is lodash@4.17.21 safe to use?"
AI: Uses scan_package tool
Result: Clean or vulnerable with details
```

### Repository Security Audit
```
You: "Scan facebook/react for security issues"
AI: Uses scan_github_repository tool
Result: All dependencies analyzed
```

### Organization-Wide Scan
```
You: "Check all repos in my-company for malware"
AI: Uses scan_github_organization tool
Result: Org-wide security report
```

### Bulk Dependency Check
```
You: "Check these packages: lodash, express, axios"
AI: Uses scan_dependencies tool
Result: Batch security analysis
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Simple
First test with single packages, then move to repositories, then organizations.

### Tip 2: Use Malware-Only Mode
For faster scans, use malware-only mode:
```
"Scan my-org for malware (malware only)"
```

### Tip 3: Combine with GitHub MCP
Install both GitHub MCP and RoguePkg MCP for powerful workflows:
```
"List all JavaScript repos in my-org and scan them for security issues"
```

### Tip 4: Set Up Verification
Run `verify_setup.py` after any configuration changes.

### Tip 5: Check Examples First
The [examples/mcp_examples.md](examples/mcp_examples.md) file has patterns for common tasks.
